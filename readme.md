## Laravel PHP Based Blog

This was a Laravel PHP based blog project that I was asked to do as a coding example.

## Project Requirements

Using Laravel, make a simple blog site. It's ok if it is an ugly duck, just make it functional. When you are done, send us a link. :)

Required features:
* Needs to have comments.

* Filter posts by Author.

* Paginated post list.

* JSON (and/or XML) feed of recent posts.

Bonus points for:
* Comments in the framework, instead of Disqus.

* HTML Editor (e.g. CKEditor). BBCode or Markdown (like Github) acceptable.

* Layout using SCSS and/or Foundation responsive.


Extra bonus for:
* Github or other source control.
